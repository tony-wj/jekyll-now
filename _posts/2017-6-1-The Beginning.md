# The Beginning

A new start.

I'm a student from HKU. My interests include web applications, data analysis and system optimization. Currently, I'm studying operations research and following Dr.J.W.Wang from IMSE department. 

The idea of writing my own blog comes from the book I'm reading now: *Dark Time* (《暗时间》). As the author says, writing a blog is a efficient way to learn. 

I'll try to keep udating, but I still have to do my Engineering Training and another project at the same time. Luckily it's summer holiday now and I have plenty of time in the next three month.

Hope you will like my blogs.

在语言选择方面， 我会尽量使用中文。由于我看的文献大多是英文，这样有助于锻炼我在语言切换状态下的表达能力。毕竟，如何让别人理解你的意思是一项了不起的能力。
